## N-body Simulation & Contents of this Repository
This repository contains several programs written in either a sequential way or a parallel way, each of which approximates the motion of N particles under the following physical law: particles interact with each other through gravitational force. The four parallel programs are written in MPI, pthread, openMP, as well as the hybrid MPI/openMP codes. Though none of these programs are written in the most advanced algorithms, it still gives interesting insights through comparisons of these programs on their runtime performances as well as comparisons of a single program under different conditions. Factors considered making a difference on the runtime result typically includes the input size, the number of cores or threads for parallel programs. For the hybrid MPI/openMP program, both the number of cores and the number of threads are taken into considerations.
